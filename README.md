# Emerging Technologies

This is a 4th Year Project for Emerging Technologies for sortware development.
The project involves writing documentation, code, and comments
in the programming language Python and using the Jupyter notebook software.

The following are the notebooks and a brief description of what they contain:

1. numpy random notebook: a jupyter notebook explaining the concepts
behind and the use of the numpy random package, including plots
of the various distributions.

2. Iris dataset notebook: a jupyter notebook explaining the famous
iris data set including the difficulty in writing an algorithm to separate
the three classes of iris based on the variables in the dataset.

3. MNIST dataset notebook: a jupyter notebook explaining how to
read the MNIST dataset efficiently into memory in Python.

4. Digit recognition script: a Python script that takes an image file
containing a handwritten digit and identifies the digit using a supervised
learning algorithm and the MNIST dataset.

5. Digit recognition notebook: a jupyter notebook explaining how the
above Python script works and discussing its performance.
